# State Capitals
### This project is a dictionary of US states and their corresponding capitals

It will prompt the user for a US state and return its capital. This is the first part of a larger project to catalogue information about US states. It runs in the command line.

This program will continue to prompt the user for a state until it gets a valid response.
